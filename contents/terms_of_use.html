                    <h2>SPAM POLICY</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>dwscpunjab.gov.in does not send spam</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nor do we condone or tolerate the sending of spam by anyone associated with us. If you think you have received spam from dwscpunjab.gov.in please read the following explanation of how an unrelated sender can make you believe you have received spam from us. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, "spammers" routinely try to make you think that a third party has sent the offending e-mail. There are many ways spammers can do this to hide their true identity. One such method is called "spoofing." That is where they use a different e-mail address than their own in the "from" line of the message. In order to find out the true origin of the e-mail, try going to "View" followed by "Options" in your Microsoft Outlook and reading the "Internet Headers." Although not a fool-proof method, you can usually trace the true origin of the spam this way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before you accuse anyone of spamming, please be sure to verify your suspicions before taking any action that might itself be harmful to innocent parties. If you contact other people and wrongly accuse dwscpunjab.gov.in of having sent you spam, those false accusations are potentially harmful to us and our business. If done recklessly, the making of such false accusations can constitute unlawful business libel and is akin to yelling "fire" in a crowded theatre - something we cannot and will not tolerate. Instead, we welcome your sincere inquiries and will do our best to resolve any question or complaint we receive. Please send us any offending spam if you may receive. As a courtesy to you, we will try to show you how the spam was sent from a party not connected to us. If it appears that you have wrongly accused us of having sent spam, we expect you to contact anyone with whom you may have shared that false accusation so that you may retract that statement.
