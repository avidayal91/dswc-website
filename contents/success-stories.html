                              The project has given a much needed opportunity to the farming community of the project area as the villagers have not only ventured into conventional agriculture but even some of them, given the support of Department have started growing cash crops such as vegetables and horticulture crops. The Department in order to provide assured marketing of such crops had made elaborate arrangements with local processing units. The training centre which has been set up as part of project besides providing trainings on agricultural and technological aspects are also providing livelihood based trainings to landless and women community. Because of proximity of urban areas, allied activities such as dairy farming is mushrooming as fodder cultivation earlier dependent on rainfall, is now being grown all over the year. This besides giving an additional source of income has also provided a fiscal cushion for the local populace. Encouraged by assured irrigation, the farmers are also opting for mechanized tools such as tillers etc for agriculture compared to purely traditional agriculture followed earlier.

The project include saving in the productive farm land by removing field channels and also saving in time, energy and labour cost. Field crop production and water availability has been increased. The cost of the land has also been increased after laying pipeline. Today farmers have a joy on their face.

                              By utilising the pond water for irrigation by laying Under Ground Pipe line, efficient use of Available water was accomplished.UGPL is helping saving of about 30% water as compared to open channels annually. As there is zero withdrawal of ground water in the command area, this project is surely limiting the declining water table in this declared Over-Exploited area with respect to ground water Development. About 3% of additional land is put under agriculture which will increase per unit production. As now no open channel for irrigation, therefore, no regular cleaning required and hence there is decreased labour input. Continuous use of organic matter rich pond water for agriculture will reduce the fertilizer consumption as well as will improve the soil conditions for a better plant growth. Now there is decreased power consumption for irrigation, thereby reducing cost of production and hence making agriculture more profitable.As now the pond water is utilised fully for agriculture, there is no overflowing water into the residential area, which is greatly helping in checking the spread of water/vector borne diseases in the village and the project has also improved the village aesthetically.

The purpose of this project was also to create mass awareness about the importance of UGPS and also its role in socio economic upliftment of the beneficiaries. Main objective was also to give assured irrigation facilities to the farmers and also to save precious water and conserve the ground water.

                                  UGPS according to our analysis has lead to about 22-25% saving of irrigation water as compared to irrigation carried out by open channels earlier.

                                  Due to availability of water to all the command area, usage of electricity pump sets has been reduced thereby helping in increase of groundwater table of the area.

                              This intervention had a great impact in term of area under irrigation. Earlier water is not available for irrigation for this area, now got sufficient amount of water due to laying of underground pipe line. Pipeline was installed beneath the earth surface so there is also land saving. Water becomes available so yield of this area is increased. Thus social economical life of this area is also enhanced.

                              Under Ground Pipe Line (UGPL) system, which uses irrigation pipes placed underground to fetch the water from the source to the field, provides the most appropriate solution to tackle the above mentioned problems. Depending on the mean sea level of the source and the fields, UGPL system can bring water by gravity or by lifting and by carrying irrigation water from a source well to the field with pressure. UGPL system minimizes water losses during conveyance from water bodies to farmers’ field. Further, maintenance of irrigation channels is a bigger problem particularly during paddy growing season when weed intensity is at peak. By creating underground conveyance system, thus, additional land is also effectively brought under cultivation by saving on the lands lost in making irrigation channels.

                                  There is significant increase in crop productivity due to use of UGPL system in the fields. The increase is around 20% for paddy &amp; 25% for wheat.

                                  There is saving of water as well. The average saving of water in irrigating one acre of paddy field is around 20% whereas the same is around 25% for the wheat crop.

The cultivated area also increased and hence the yield increased as the area under open channel was used for taking production and whole area got equal water. There was reduction in  maintenance cost and labour cost. The economic condition of the farmers increased as there was increased in production, reduction in labour and maintenance cost.
