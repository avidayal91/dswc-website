                  <div class="text-container">
                      <p>
                          The Kandi belt comprising 10% of the total area of the State is predominately rainfed, infact the name Kandi is Urdu word meaning 'Water Scarce'. The area suffers from acute shortage of drinking water besides poor socio-economic conditions of farmers. Hoshiarpur district falls in this kandi belt and is characterized by highest number of seasonal choes (rivulets) criss-crossing its lands but due to undulating topography and steep slopes, most of it gets wasted as runoff. Soil erosion is another major concern in this area as during monsoon period most of fertile soils gets eroded, thereby leaving farmers with double whammy i.e. unavailability of assured irrigation source coupled with soil degradation. These problems are just tip of iceberg as largely being forest area, the agriculture is threatened by wild animals. The farmers could not even grow fruits or vegetables for thier households needs because of threat of wild animals. Being sub-mountenous and remote area, the electricity supply is highly unreliable, mainly because of logists involved. The productivity is among the lowest as farmers are only able to cultivate single crop in a year and that too at mercy of rainfalls only. Govt of Punjab taking stock of this situation, constructed Kandi canal, called lifeline of kandi area, but the irony was that the area to the right of canal being at lower elevation is irrigated through gravitational flow whereas the area to the right of canal being at higher elevation could be irrigated utilizing lift irrigation only.

                         <h3>Details of Project executed: </h3>
                         <p>
                            The Govt of Punjab approved the project with total cost of 42.10 cr with funding from under RKVY and NABARD. The work on project was started in January, 2015 and was divided into three phases. The Project was completed and commissioned on 7th August, 2017. The project shall be operated and maintained by Department by hand holding local community and Water User Associations(WUA's) for initial 7 years thus providing gestation period for farmers to develop their fiscal and technical capacity. The project initially planned as a conventional irrigation project spanned out to be World's most innovative and largest Integrated Solar Powered Lift -Micro Irrigation Project mainly because of stakeholders' efforts and keen participation. The main stakeholders i.e. community of project area belongs to poor socio-economic strata and was solely dependent upon rains for agriculture. Farmers were not able to utilize water from kandi canal, flowing nearby because their agricultural lands were located at higher elevation and lift based system was required from canal to irrigate their lands. The project was designed as integrated solar powered, fully computerized and automated micro irrigation project wherein the solar energy gives leverage over grid based systems besides micro irrigation and automation helping water conservation and equitable distribution of scarce resource respectively. The project consists of 3 main lift points from kandi canal and to enable water to reach at higher elevations, booster stations (sump wells) are also provided at various points. The following systems have been installed

                          <p>
                            The project has given a much needed opportunity to the farming community of the project area as the villagers have not only ventured into conventional agriculture but even some of them, given the support of Department have started growing cash crops such as vegetables and horticulture crops.  The Department in order to provide assured marketing of such crops had made elaborate arrangements with local processing units. The training centre  which has been set up as part of project besides providing trainings on agricultural and technological aspects are also providing livelihood based trainings to landless and women community.  Because of proximity of urban areas, allied activities such as dairy farming is mushrooming as fodder cultivation earlier dependent on rainfall, is now being grown all over the year. This besides giving an additional source of income has also provided a fiscal cushion for the local populace. Encouraged by assured irrigation, the farmers are also opting for mechanized tools such as tillers etc for agriculture compared to purely traditional agriculture followed earlier.

                          <p>
                              Due to project interventions, barren lands are now brimming with agricultural activity. Farmers of area for first time ever; have grown crops in last years' Rabi season besides, productivity has more than doubled in just last two seasons since farmers started getting irrigation water. Fencing erected as part of project has thwarted the threat of wild animals, helping farmers to diversify into vegetables and horticulture crops. People who earlier migrated for work are now tilling their own lands and linkages established with local processing units are helping farmers getting instant cash returns. Training centre besides a demonstration farm provides farmers the latest knowhow by roping in experts from prestigious institutions. The project has also given employment to local youth, who are working in project as helpers and guards. The comparative figures of pre and post project are as follows:

                          <p>
                              The water quality is very poor which is not fit for irrigation. Due to lack of canal irrigation, the farmers cannot irrigate their fields properly. But at some locations the water quality is good and at these places farmers install the tubewells. Due to irrigate their fields through water channels (kacca), about 25-30% water go waste. This is also a labour consuming, time taken and money wastage process. Mostly the farmers have less than 1 ha land and cannot afford high cost labour and machinery and also due to poor quality water they are not in a position to get good yield and cash back.

                              To save water, time and money, the farmers of this village decide to layout the underground pipes. As per the site conditions and the discharge of the tubewell, the project of 450 mm dia pipes of about 1280 mtr. length covering an area of 28.05 hectare owned by 36 beneficiaries, including 26 men and 10 women farmers, the project has been initiated under RKVY scheme by approving cost of Rs. 1274000/- in the year 2016-17. The project has been approved by giving 90% govt. subsidy and 10% farmers share. The farmers layout the pipeline themselves by taking permission from the dept. in the favour of Sh.

                          <p>
                              After laying the underground pipes, there is no seepage of water and a lot of water now saved. The farmers now irrigate their fields properly. The project include saving in the productive farm land by removing field channels and also saving in time, energy and labour cost. Field crop production and water availability has been increased. The cost of the land has also been increased after laying pipeline. Today farmers have a joy on their face.

                          <h3>Pre Project and Post Project Status/Comparison</h3>
                          <p>
                              From production point of view, the farmers took only rice crop after laying of pipeline and they got about 12-15 qt/ha more yield than before execution of the project. Water availability has also been increased. Before execution of pipeline, the water reaches to the fields at slow rate because most of the water go waste through seepage of kacca water channels but after execution there is no seepage and rate of flow has also increased. Because of availability of assured irrigation water, socio economic conditions have also improved.

                              The water quality is very poor which is not fit for irrigation. Due to lack of canal irrigation, the farmers cannot irrigate their fields properly. But at some locations the water quality is good and at these places farmers install the tubewells. Due to irrigate their fields through water channels (kacca), about 25-30% water go waste. This is also a labour consuming, time taken and money wastage process. Mostly the farmers have less than 1 ha land and cannot afford high cost labour and machinery and also due to poor quality water they are not in a position to get good yield and cash back.
