              <div class="h2-sub_content">
                  <h3>Underground Pipeline System (UGPS)</h3>
                  <p>
                      Replacement of open irrigation channels with underground pipeline system for conveyance. It helps save about 30% water. Farmers can opt for RCC, PVC or HDPE pipes
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Laying of underground pipeline saves water upto extent of 30%, which is also corroborated by evaluation studies carried out by ICAR and NABARD. Saving of irrigation water to this extent means that this amount of water withdrawal from ground shall be reduced. Besides the water conservation, additional advantages for farming community is reduced labour and maintenance costs. This intervention also saves about 2-3% of land, wasted on account of construction of open channels which can be put under agricultural use.

                   <h3>Micro Irrigation(MI) - Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation systems</h3>
                   <p>
                       Ascientific method of irrigation carrying desired water and nutrients direct to the root zone of the plant, drop by drop. It is a technique in which water flows through a filter into special drip pipes, with emitters located at different spacing. Water is distributed through the emitters directly into the soil near the roots through a special slow-release device. If the drip irrigation system is properly designed, installed, and managed, drip irrigation may help achieve water conservation by reducing evaporation and deep drainage. Compared to other types of irrigation systems such as flood or overhead sprinklers, water can be more precisely applied to the plant roots. In addition, drip can eliminate many diseases that are spread through irrigation water. Drip irrigation is adaptable to any farmable slope and is suitable for most soils.

                   <h3>Laying of Underground Pipeline for Irrigation using Treated Water from Sewerage Treatment Plants</h3>
                   <p>
                       The Project aims to provide treated water from these sewerage treatment plants for irrigation through network of underground pipelines. The availability of irrigation water from this source will not only reduce stress on other water resources especially the ground water, which is declining at tremendous rate in the State. The state of Punjab has taken a major initiative under the programme “Cleaning of Rivers” for treatment of municipal waste water by installation of Sewerage Treatment Plants across all major cities, towns besides for cluster of villages wherein underground sewerage facility is available. This programme is flagship programme of State Govt and is personally monitored by Hon’ble Chief Minister, Punjab. The Punjab Water Supply and Sewerage Board along with Punjab Urban Development Agency have already installed Sewerage Treatment Plants for treatment of municipal waste water for all major cities and towns of the State. The construction of STP’s for other townships and cluster of villages are currently underway. Till date approx 45 nos of STP’s are functioning and almost 60 nos of STP’s are nearing completion along with 70 nos of STP’s are in course of planning and execution stage. This mean that abundant amount of treated water is available for utilization in agriculture.

                       <li>
                           Reduced stress on ground water aquifers, which inturn are replenished and the declining trend of water levels is arrested.
                       </li>
                       <li>
                           More potable water availability as use of treated water for irrigation purposes reduces use of potable water in agriculture.

                   <h3>Rainwater Harvesting in Kandi area</h3>
                   <p>
                       Kandi Area comprises of 538100hectares i.e. almost 10% of total area of the state. It stretches from district Mohali to district Pathankot along the border of Himachal Pradesh. It is sub mountainous zone with average rainfall of 1000mm. Agriculture in this area is mainly dependent on rains as it is predominately rainfed area. Socio economic conditions of people are poor because of scattered and small land holdings. Average agriculture yield has been only 700 Kg/Hectare against State’s 4500 Kg/Hectare. Further Kandi area being very undulating and sub mountainous, is traversed by numerous small and big seasonal streams called choes and is prone to flash floods. About 40% of this rain water gets wasted in floods, which causes considerable damages to the crops &amp; village abadies and makes the land in- fertile. These streams/choes criss-crossing the area, also holds in themselves potential to transform this area through harvesting of water. Department has initiated this programme for development of the area and recharging of ground water.

                   <h4>Advantages</h4>
                   <p>
                       These water harvesting structures are multipurpose as besides providing irrigation to command area and augmenting ground water recharge, they have helped in checking erosion, flash floods besides rejuvenating the forest cover in the catchment area. Water harvesting in perennial flows also provides life saving irrigation to farmers of the adjoining area.

                   <h3>Programme on Watershed Basis - Intergrated Watershed Management Programme</h3>
                   <p>
                       The Growth of Agriculture in Punjab, from Sixties onwards, has few parallels in the world. Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, DoLR, GOI with the objective to restore the ecological balance by harnessing, conserving and developing degraded natural resources such as soil, forest and water along with overall development of community. This programme is implemented on 60:40 Centre:State sharing basis. IWMP was first introduced in state in year 2009-10 with sanctioning of six projects in the districts of Ropar, Hoshiarpur and Gurdaspur which are currently underway. Earlier according to Common Guidelines of Watershed Management only rainfed area could be taken up under the programme but considering the falling water table in Northern states especially Punjab, amendments were made in guidelines and area with over exploited ground water resources can also be taken up under this programme. Till date total of 65 nos of projects are being implemented in the State in districts of Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Mohali, Gurdaspur, Pathankot, SBS Nagar, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Taran Taran, Ludhiana, Patiala and Fazilka. Ground water exploitation in the non kandi area taken up under the programme is very high. The average level of ground water development of the project area ranges from 130% -200% and falls in over exploited category.
