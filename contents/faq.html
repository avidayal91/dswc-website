                <p>
                    <span>What is ground water recharging?</span><br>
                    To keep a check on the continuously degrading ground water resource in Punjab, Ground Water Recharging is the only solution. Out of the total 138 of the state, 93 blocks have turned Dark where the under ground water development has crossed 100%. Under this scheme funds are taken from Central Ground Water Board for installing ground water recharging projects in the affected districts especially Patiala, Sangrur and Ropar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What is Roof Top Rain water harvesting?</span><br>
                    Roof-Top Rainwater harvesting essentially means collecting rainwater on the roofs of building and storing it underground for later use. Not only does this recharging arrest groundwater depletion, it also raises the declining water table and can help augment water supply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What is Drip &amp; Micro Sprinkler Irrigation And its benefits?</span><br>
                    The Micro Irrigation System, which includes Drip Irrigation, Micro Sprinkler Irrigation and other emitting devices which discharges irrigation water at a controlled rate and is applied directly to the root zone of the plants. It increases the productivity by 30 to 100% with 50 to 70% saving of water in various crops.  Till now 4247 hectares area has been covered under these systems in Ferozepur, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ropar and Sangrur Districts. The main fruits crops are Kinnow, Grapes, Litchi etc. and the vegetable crops are Potato &amp; Tomato.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What are benefits of Underground pipeline system?</span><br>
                    The major benefits of UGPS are by way of Land Saving and thus an increase in cultivated area. This benefit has further helped  increase in Yield, Production and Socio-Economic Upliftment of the farmers. UGPS also helps in Saving of Energy, Fertilizer, Labour and Land Development. UGPS is a highly efficient system as it has helped in catching up the time gap of conventional irrigation system. The UGPS not only needs less number of tubewells/gensets but has also helped in Ground Water Utilization in many parts of the state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What is quantitative analysis of UGPS laid by Department?</span><br>
                    The UGPS is being installed in the fields of Punjab farmers since 1967 and has played a significant role in Green Revolution. Till date, 12872 km of pipeline has been laid in Punjab state benefiting as area of 475282 ha (1188207 Acres). Also, 505 Million Units of Precious Electricity is being saved and 126.25 Lakh Man-days of labour is being saved every year. Therefore, at present, UGPS is helping the farmers and the state by generating an additional annual income of Rs. 463 Crores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What are Water Harvesting Structures and its benefits?</span><br>
                    These are structures which are built to store water which otherwise goes as runoff . It is mainly  constructed on stream , drain or where there is rain water runoff thus trapping water which otherwise goes waste. These are most beneficial in hilly (Kandi) area. It helps in life saving irrigation and micro climate has been improves and also results in substantial increase in bio-mass. It checks soil erosion and low moisture of soils increases due to seepage and percolation of water in the reservoir there is on upward trend in the ground water table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What does Makkowal Type means?</span><br>
                    The Project as envisaged in view of water needs of the people for irrigation and other purposes, looking to the availability of water from wells, near the upstream. Water in these wells was available throughout the year (preenial flow) and water level remained constant in spite of regular flow of underground water from these wells. To tap this natural flow for irrigation purpose was the object of this project. The water flows through concrete underground pipelines under gravity from upstream wells to the fields where it is used for irrigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What is Agriculture Field Drainage?</span><br>
                    Water logging is a severe problem in the State of Punjab especially in the Southern western districts. Although surface drainage is being done but many low line pockets could not be reclaimed with surface drainage system. Therefore sub surface drainage system will be done to reclaim such pockets. The work is being implemented in Ferozepur, Bathinda, Faridkot, Mukatsar, Gurdaspur, Sangrur and Nawanshahar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>What is Ravinous area?</span><br>
                    About 8000 areas on the right bank of river Beas in the district Amritsar and Gurdaspur has been identified as ravinous. This area is badly dissected and eroded. Under the programme, this area will be reclaimed and developed for agriculture and plantation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span>How irrigation can be done in Ecologically Handicapped Area?</span><br>
                    In areas where normal irrigation is not available and the ground water is also brackish and where conventional method of irrigation are not possible, perennial flows are collected by constructing sump wells and these are used for irrigation by lifting through underground irrigation conveyance system. in brackish   water area, the sweet water is taken from limited pockets through underground pipe line system.
